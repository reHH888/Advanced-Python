Question 3: Write a Python program that classifies an employee's performance
based on their performance rating.
Requirements:

â€¢ Create a variable named rate to store the employee's performance rating (a
number between 1 and 5, where 5 is the highest).
â€¢ Implement the following rating system:
o If the rate is 5 or higher, print "Your Rate Is Excellent".
o If the rate is between 3 and 4 (inclusive), print "Your Rate Is Good".
o If the rate is between 2 and 2.99, print "Your Rate Is Bad".
o If the rate is below 2, print "Your Rate Is Very Bad".
